# QIMOS
QIMOS stuff and tools.

The idea of this repo is to provide some tools and guides on how to work with the [IMOS-ANMN Long Time Series Products](https://github.com/aodn/python-aodntools/tree/master/aodntools/timeseries_products), the IMOS individual files from the ANMN and to get some variables of interest from other sources. You will find some utility functions in the [Code directory](https://github.com/diodon/QIMOS/tree/main/Code) (in Python, R and Bash), and some guides on how to use them in the [Guides directory]().
